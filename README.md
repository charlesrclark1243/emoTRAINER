# emoTRAINER

As a kid, I had difficulties understanding social cues and interacting with others. As I grew up, social skills became much more natural to me, however, many people experiencing similar struggles have to work very hard to achieve the same. Although social interaction is almost second nature to me now, I have never forgotten the social difficulties of my childhood, nor have I forgotten the feelings of isolation that came with them. Because of this, I wanted to work on a project that could help other people with experiences similar to my own. This project is exactly that: it is meant to be a tool that people who struggle socially can use in training themselves to understand the social skills which seem to come naturally to others. More specifically, this tool is meant to train the user in understanding the emotions implied by a person's facial expression.

The idea for this project came to me in September 2021, however I've had to scrap several implementations since; the current source code is the first implementation I managed to get working. The application is made up of two components: a frontend GUI implemented with Java and JavaFX, and a backend which uses Python and the FER package to detect emotion from an uploaded image of a person's face. The command line is the bridge which connects the Java frontend and the Python backend; it feeds input from the frontend to the backend and output from the backend to the frontend. I understand that this is probably not the best way to connect the two components, however given the differences between the Java and Python languages, using the command line was the simplest way to do so. As I continue to work on this project, I'll be sure to research different ways to bridge the two languages which might be a good replacement for the current command line method. 

This current build is not the final version, I'll most likely be working on this for some time. However, between work and school, it might be difficult to update as regularly as I'd prefer. Nonetheless, I'll make sure to work on improvements and update this repository whenever I can.
